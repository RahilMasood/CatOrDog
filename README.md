# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model utilizes Keras and TensorFlow to create and train the neural network, allowing it to learn the difference between the two animals based on a dataset of labeled images.

## Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can classify images as either "cat" or "dog." The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process image data. The neural network learns patterns and features from images through layers like convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Once trained, the model can predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog.

## Dependencies

Before running this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used in this project consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional Layers: These layers use a set of filters to process the input image and detect patterns such as edges or shapes. In this project, there are two convolutional layers, each with 32 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3).
- Max-Pooling Layer: This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to reduce computation. It uses a pool size of (2, 2) to downsample the feature maps.
- Flatten Layer: This layer flattens the output from the pooling layer into a one-dimensional vector to feed it into fully connected layers.
- Fully Connected Layers: These layers perform classification based on the learned features. The network has three fully connected layers with 64, 128, and 64 units, respectively, and ReLU activation. Dropout is used to prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating 50% of the neurons during training.
- Output Layer: The final layer has a single unit with a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a binary classification: 1 for a dog and 0 for a cat.
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. By training the model on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images, the neural network can learn to distinguish between the two animals. Once trained, the model can be used to make accurate predictions on new images.
